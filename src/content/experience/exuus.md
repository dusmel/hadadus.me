# Description
- Lead the engineering team.
  - Created a cli app for automating devops related processes ( deploying ), making  dev experience more enjoyable.
  - Worked on the major revamping of both the dashboard and mobile app.
  - Helped to create a dedicated company-wide documentation on notion, prior to that documents were kept on Google Drive without a proper way of finding things. I worked on a set of template that would accommodate all the teams not just the engineering team. Also worked on a guideline that streamlined all in-house processes.
